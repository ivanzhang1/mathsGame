Before its name is mathsGame. it is just for an exam on unit testing. Its main function is unit testing for FizzBuzz game. Finally, I'm rejected by this company. So, I think I need do more and should't think about it as a small program.

Tools:
1. TestNG
2. Maven
3. Selenium 
4. Firefox Driver

later, we will try to integrated it into Jenkins.
